        <p>I have been playing League since season three and am fascinated by the complex elements of the game. My focus as a coach is to make you the best League player you can be; whether that be honing in on the fundamentals or taking your gameplay to the next level. 

            My background is in teaching, I use these skills to tailor my sessions towards your learning needs and league goals. </p>
